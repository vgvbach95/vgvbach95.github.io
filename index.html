                        <p>
                            There is no greater satisfaction than bringing something to life, whether it be in engineering
                            or in art. <br><br>
                            I am a crafter. I love creating costumes and outfits that would otherwise exist on a page or
                            a screen. Halloween is my favorite holiday, and I have designed and built haunted houses for
                            charity during my Freshman and Sophmore years of college. My ongoing quest is to merge
                            tech into my creations.<br><br>
                            I also draw and do graphic design when needed, with much of my published work being
                            conference media for Reflections|Projections by ACM@UIUC.

                            This outfit was my first encounter with a large sewing project. I did the entire outfit from
                            scratch in just a month and debuted it at Anime Midwest 2015.<br><br>
                            This was also my first time using EL-Wire. I stitched the wire into the tie and fashioned it
                            to my legs to add a more electronic sense to the outfit.<br><br>
                            All photography credit goes to Pritan Vora.<br><br>
                            The character is Vocaloid Hatsune Miku, and the outfit is from the 2015 Magical Mirai holographic
                            concert in Japan. My work is purely for my own enjoyment, and I do not own the character nor
                            am affiliated with Crypton Media.

                            While I did not make the outfit, I made the 3DMG. The gear was entirely built out of
                            cardboard, and was clumsy, but close to the right size. My main task in it was to design
                            blades that could be removed from the handles and swapped out, just in case one got damaged
                            during a convention.<br><br>
                            Doing a "crossplay" - dressing as a gender other than the one you affiliate with - is a major
                            make-up challenge. I learned how to add depth and contouring to my own face to give the illusion
                            of having masculine features. Makeup is truly an art form in itself and can greatly help bring
                            a character to life.<br><br>
                            My work is purely for my own enjoyment, and I do not own the character.

                        <p>
                            I have been waist deep in code ever since I unknowningly volunteered to be on the programming
                            team for a high school robotics club.<br><br>
                            Since then, I have experimented with many applications of Computer Science. My focus is Machine
                            Learning and Artificial Intelligence with a special niche for robotics. Through internships,
                            classes, and personal projects, I have dabbled in
                            everything from wearable electronics to front end and back end web development to data visualization
                            to virtual reality to automated testing. I love expanding my boundaries and discovering
                            new ways to bring this hodgepodge set of skills together.

                            Sample Horror Game with scotopic and photopic vision experiment for the Oculus Rift.  Requires Unity Pro 4 to modify.<br><br>
                            Authors: Victoria Vanderbach and Jessica Spratley<br><br>
                            Goal: Imitate the human eye adjustments between low light vision and day time vision in a video game setting on the Oculus Rift.<br><br>
                            Background:<br><br>
                            Ever walked into a dark room and couldn't see at first, but over time, you begin to be able to see despite the low light?<br><br>
                            The human eye has mechanisms to help you see in any amount of light.
                            We wanted to simulate this temporary blinding sensation and the transitions in
                            virtual reality to add a level of comfort to the VR experience.<br><br>
